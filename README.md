# Canceled

## About this Project
- Built by Grace Nieboer and Kimberly Benton
- An introverts Best Friend
- This application is a social platform that allows users to add friends to their friend network and add plans with those friends to a personal calendar. 
The best part is the cancellation feature. When a friend decides for any reason that they want to cancel plans, they can cancel the plans and a push notification will be sent to the other person notifying them of the cancellation which can then be rescheduled for a later date if desired.
